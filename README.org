Reconstruction of the data used to generate the scatterplots in York University's AAPR task force reports.

[[extract.org]] has all of the data and code; it can be used to reproduce everything I did.  [[extract.pdf]] is a nice human-readable version.

The raw data (a combination of the provided program code list and the reconstructed Quality and Sustainability rankings) is in [[aapr.csv]].
